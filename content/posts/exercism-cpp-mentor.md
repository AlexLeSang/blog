_You do not truly understand a topic unless you can explain it to somebody else._

### What is Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a platform where people can learn programming languages.

What is it for: learning programming languages **quick**, **easy**, **hands-on** and **right**.

How does it work:
- you have instruction how to set up the environment
- you have simple exercise
- you have unit tests
- you run a unit test: it fails
- you google some basics: make the test pass
- repeat previous two steps until all provided unit tests pass

Then is the fun part: you push it to the platform (submit) and **a living person with relevant experience**, called _mentor_ looks at what you have done and **gives you feedback**! Neat, eh?
No need to guess if you make something acceptable or it was just a happy accident. Apply the comments and learn.

Unfortunately, there are some problems with that.

First: you have to wait for your feedback: that is what drives people off. More time passes between the moment you have pushed the exercise the more context you have already forgotten.
Mentors are volunteers, and they are busy. It can take days before you get any response.

Second: what you have submitted, depending on the problem and programming language, may require extensive feedback.
The feedback may consists of what you did not do exactly right (or completely wrong), what you should have done, and why certain things should be considered or used.

## What it means to be a mentor

Being a mentor is highly rewarding for me, I love it. I love seeing how people approach the same problem in different ways.
People with background in different languages bring over their 'styles': I learn from it. Answering questions or giving a feedback require research.
I like having discussions.
I like knowing that by giving proper explanation today on subject why one should avoid using that particular concept, I may avoid having to tear my hair in some project tomorrow.
I like explaining to people concepts that took me a lot of pain to understand. C++ is full of 'magic'.

In order to address that we're working on new iteration of Exercism to give students faster feedback and to reduce load on mentors. The idea is to get students through basic language concepts: independently and automatically.

#### Mentor for C++

C++ is an old language: lots and lots of 'baggage'. Compatibility with C means that almost everything that programmer types in - compiles, then crashes.
Undefined behavior, no garbage collection, raw memory access, strange features: all that makes it harder make something which is safe.

Writing safe C++ comes with experience. To get that experience you either have to earn that or you have to actively look for it.
The fact that even really unsafe code compiles and **almost always** works makes it harder to justify the point of why one should try to make it better.
That is why so many people find C++ code snippets that **work** but are not what I would call proper **Modern C++**.

**Modern C++** every standard of C++-11 and further: designed to make the language safer and simpler.

The challenge is to overcome what I see every day at work: **not** **Modern C++**.
I have to learn what is the best way to do that and explain that in the way that in accessible.

## Conclusions

Mentoring C++ track for Exercism is highly rewarding way of getting more people to learn **Modern C++**.
Being aware of professional biases while giving feedback is extremely important for C++ track. Getting to safe code requires paradigm shift.

If you are a C++ developer wanting to help C++ grow, make future C++ code bases better, propel your understanding of the language or just help people new to the language, please join Exercism!
