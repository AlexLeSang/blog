# Exercism - C++ and future

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a platform where people can learn programming languages.

What is it for:
- you want to learn programming language
- you want to learn it **fast** and **right**

Idea is simple and brilliant: 
- you have simple exercise
- you have unit tests
- you have instruction how to set up the environment
- you run the test: it fails
- you google some basics: make the test pass
- repeat previous two steps until all provided unit tests pass

Then is the fun part: you push it and **a living person with relevant experience**, called _mentor_ looks at what you have done and **gives you feedback**! How cool is that?! No need to guess if you make something acceptable or it was just a happy accident. Apply the comments and learn.

Unfortunately, there are some problems with that. First: you have to wait for your feedback. Mentors are volunteers, and they are busy. Second: what you have submitted, depending on the problem and language, may result in one line comment or require a full page explanation. The explanation may consists of what you did not exactly right (or completely wrong), what you should have done and why.

Do not get me wrong, I love being mentor. I love seeing how people approach the same problem in different ways. People with background in different languages bring over their 'styles'. I like having discussions. I like knowing that by giving proper explanation today on subject why one should avoid using that particular concept, I may avoid having to tear my hair in some project tomorrow.

In order to address that we're working on new iteration of Exercism to give students faster feedback and to reduce load on mentors. The idea is to get students through basic language concepts: independently and automatically.

### C++ - spefics [TODO]

C++ is an old language: lots and lots of 'baggage'. Compatibility with C means that almost everything that programmer types in - compiles, then crashes.

## Conclusion [TODO]
